# Customer Churn Predictor (Telco)

An end-to-end **Machine Learning** project that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn.  
Built with **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, this project covers data preprocessing, model training, and interactive web app deployment.

---

## Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based businesses like telecom companies.  
This project uses historical customer data to:
- Predict the probability of churn.
- Provide insights into key factors driving churn.
- Help businesses take proactive measures to retain customers.

---

## Features
- End-to-end ML pipeline (data cleaning â†’ model training â†’ evaluation).
- Preprocessing of both numeric and categorical features.
- Interactive Streamlit web app for predictions.
- Probability-based output with visualisations.
- Easily deployable to **Streamlit Cloud**.

Dataset
We use the Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle.
It contains customer demographic and service information, along with a churn indicator.

Target variable:
Churn â†’ Yes (1) or No (0)

Usage
1. Train the Model
bash
Copy
Edit
python src/train_model.py
This:

Loads and preprocesses the dataset.

Trains the ML model.

Saves the trained pipeline to models/churn_pipeline.pkl.

2. Run the Streamlit App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
This:

Loads the trained pipeline.

Provides a sidebar for entering customer details.

Displays churn probability, prediction result, and a simple visualisation.


Streamlit Interface
Features:

Sidebar sliders, dropdowns, and inputs for customer details.

Instant prediction upon button click.

Probability display with a bar chart.

Colour-coded churn warning.
